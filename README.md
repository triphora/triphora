Greetings! I'm [**Emma Alexia Triphora**](https://lexi.bike/about), a mildly queer humanoid born and raised in the great state of [Delaware](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Delaware). A pretentious description of myself involves the designations of "polymath", "wordsmith", and "philhellene"; a less pretentious description involves "nitpicker", "stoic", and "oversleeper".

If you know me, it's probably from my work at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com), where I've held various roles since April 2021. Currently, I hold the position of Growth Manager, which involves maintaining a plethora of varied activities, including but not limited to moderation, marketing, community management, and documentation.

When it comes to the non-digital world, I am a student and an avid anti-car advocate. The [local bus system](https://dartfirststate.com) gets me just about everywhere I need to go.

Minecraft modding is what most of my free time tends to be devoted to. If you've ever played a modded Minecraft instance on 1.19 or above, whether it be Forge, Fabric, or Quilt, you've run a bit of code written by me.

Check out [my website](https://lexi.bike/about) for more information about me.
