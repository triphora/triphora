Greetings! I'm Emma Alexia Triphora, also known online as `triphora`, and formerly `wafflecoffee` and `Emmaffle`. Generally speaking, I tend to cause problems, despite being well-intentioned (most of the time).

You might know me as the Growth Manager over at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com), where I've held [various roles](TIMELINE.md) over the past few years. I also used to volunteer in various communities, such as [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org) and [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org).

Minecraft modding is what most of my free time tends to be devoted to. If you've ever played a modded Minecraft instance on 1.19 or above, whether it be Forge, Fabric, or Quilt, you've run a bit of code written by me.

- Minecraft modding is how I learned Java :coffee:, Rust :crab:, and Groovy :star:.
- Μιλάω ελληνικά, αλλά αγγλικά είναι η μητρική μου γλώσσα.

### Java/Groovy code preferences

- I used to use 2-space indentation, but now I use tabs. [Learn why.](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1541761871585464323)
- One-line `if`, `for`, and `while` statements when feasible
- Annotations go on the same line for parameters and fields
- :star:: Declosureify and deparenthesize all the things!
